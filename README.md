👋 Hi, I’m @Bree-cherono
 I’m interested in data science, machine learning, and all things tech.
 I’m currently learning data analysis, Python programming, and AI tools.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects, especially those involving real-world data applications.
📫 You can reach me out via :bcherono801@gmail.com Fun fact: I love finding patterns in data and turning them into insights!
